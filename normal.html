        <h1 class="txt">  ㅤHello! And welcome to your full ㅤguide to making a third party store. To start download and extract the zip file at the top of the screen. Now if you do not all ready have a github.com account go ahead and make one. Now make a new repo and upload the files.</h1>

        <img class="pict" src="img/looklike.png">

        <h1 class="txt"> ㅤIt should like like this [you don'tㅤ ㅤㅤneed the zip file] Now go to ㅤㅤsettings --> pages --> on source click main, then save. Now looking at code you can see github pages active.  </h1>

        <img class="pict" src="img/pages.png">

        <h1 class="txt"> And boom now you should be able to see the begging of your store!</h1>

        <img class="phoneimg" src="img/phoneimg1.png">

        <h1 class="txt"> Now go back to your code on GitHub and open up Index.HTML From There Begin by changing the title where it says NAMEGOESHERE change it to the name you are going to make your third party store A little farther down you'll see another area where it says NAMEGOESHERE again replace that with your third party stores name. Right next to it you will see a place where it says put a LINK TO ICON here For this you need to have A direct download link to your icon There are a few ways to do this. Number one if you're getting your icon off of Google hit copy link address and paste it or where it says to paste your icon link. Number two by uploading an image into the files folder then typing img/thenameof- -yourimagefile.thefileextention [png, jpeg, ect.] Last is by uploading it to Dropbox then creating a download link. At the end of your download link make sure to change the 0 to a 1. Then paste that in the icon URL </h1>
